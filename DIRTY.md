At the beginning of this year I attempted to issue one notebook per week, to be able to better experiment with some features of the notebook. From what I can remember (from a feature list lost among my handwritten notes ðŸ˜…), I wanted to add some guidelines to the full notes pages.

Beginning Week 4, however, I begun experimenting with [recalendar.me](https://recalendar.me) and a Monthly calendar for the month of February. Though the layout of this set of $\LaTeX$ templates is superior, I have found the simplicity of [recalendar.js](https://github.com/klimeryk/recalendar.js/) to be very attractive. It doesn't have a dot grid version yet, but that's something [I can try to code for it](https://github.com/mihaibirsan/recalendar.js/).
